Conway's Game of life using python and pygame

this is my first repository on github 

I'm trying to do a version of conway's game of life written using python and pygame for UI, There is almost finished only things missing as speed changes and improve the UI.
I do this have something to write on vacation. Versions are well commented and explained but only in Spanish.
It is not difficult but fun :D
